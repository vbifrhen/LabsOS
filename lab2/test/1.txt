A student in the dining room sits down at the table with the teacher. He tells him:
	- The goose is not a friend to the pig!
Student:


	- Well, I flew, - and leaves.
The teacher decided to fail him in the exam, but the student answered
Great. The teacher asks a question:
	- You are walking along the road and see 2 bags: one with the mind, the other with
gold. Which one will you take?
	- With gold!
	- And I would take it wisely.
	- Who lacks what?
The teacher writes “goat” in his record book and he leaves without noticing. On
the next day the student returns and says:
	- Professor, you signed my record book, but forgot to give me a grade.
